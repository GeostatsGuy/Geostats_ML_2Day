# 2 Day Course - Data Analytics, Geostatistics and Machine Learning

2D course on geostatistics and machine learning  

#### Course Objectives:

You will gain:
* knowledge concerning basic data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning for subsurface modeling.

#### Course Agenda
* Introduction: objectives, plan
* General Overview - essential concepts from geostatistics
* Data analytics - definitions, bootstrap, declustering
* Spatial continuity - variogram  calculation and modeling, trend modeling and spatial estimations
* Limitations with Geostatistics
* Machine Learning - dimensionality reduction, k-nearest neighbours, decision trees
* Conclusions

#### The Instructor:

### Michael Pyrcz, Associate Professor, University of Texas at Austin 
*Novel Data Analytics, Geostatistics and Machine Learning Subsurface Solutions*

With over 17 years of experience in subsurface consulting, research and development, Michael has returned to academia driven by his passion for teaching and enthusiasm for enhancing engineers' and geoscientists' impact in subsurface resource development.

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!
